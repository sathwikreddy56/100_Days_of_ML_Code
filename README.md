# 100 Days Of ML Code 
#### Use app: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=softwaredotcom.swdc-100-days-of-code for review of our progress
### Day 0: April 8, 2020 (prerequisites)

**Today's Progress**: 
    1. Importing the required libraries for the Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Python, Java, CUDA Development 
    2. Selecting and scheduling of the next important topics and its examples
    3. Finding datasets and related materials and imported few of the datasets from various sources

**Thoughts:** I've researched about linear and logistic regression examples and found quite a few examples as mentioned in Links.txt

### Day 1: April 9, 2020 (Linear Regression in python)
**Today's Progress**: 
    1. Implemented Linear Regression on boston Dataset with Python SkLearn libraries
    2. Implemented Linear Regression from cratch in python 

**Issues**
    1. Linux system in built python version should not be changed as it may cause huge effect on the operation system
    2. References need to be stored as we might need it later

**Deviations**
    1. Reinstalling OS today due to issues created 

**Thoughts:** In linear regression we have to select the variables that are highly corelated negatively or positively to get better results  

### Day 2: April 10, 2020 (Linear Regression in c)
**Today's Progress**: 
    1. Reading csv files in c
    2. Normalizing the dataset in c 
    3. Functions related to calculations manually
    4. completed linear regression algorithim implementation from scratch in C language
    
**Issues**
    1. C file create is not stable while loading the data to array the data is corrupt sometimes need to understan why this happens.

**Thoughts:** Numpy library inbuild functions are easy to use but effort to write them in c is the real challenge
